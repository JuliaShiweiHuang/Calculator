• Computations must be done in order of precedence. For this assignment, ˆ has the highest
precedence, followed by ∗, / (same precedence), and finally +, − (same precedence). Multiple operators with the
same precedence are handled in left-to-right order.

• Stacks MUST be used to determine the answer. You must implement the stack using a
linked-list (do not use STL). 

• Several steps are necessary to solve this problem. First you must convert the input infix
expression to postfix. Then find the solution to the postfix expression. 
One problem you must tackle is how to store the intermediate postfix expression.
